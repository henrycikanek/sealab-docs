# Remote Accessing SEA Lab iMacs

## From a mac:

1. Connect to Vanderbilt VPN
2. Press “command” and “K” at the same time to open this window that lets you connect to the servers.
3. Type in the IP address of the iMac that you wish to remote into. You can click on “+” to save the IP address under Favorite Servers so that you don’t have to keep typing it every time you want to remote access the iMac.

   IP addresses:
   - Whale: vnc://10.2.141.209/
   - Shark: vnc://10.2.141.65/
   - Dolphin: vnc://10.2.141.7/
   - Octopus: vnc://10.2.141.54/
   - Squid: vnc://10.2.141.226/

4. Select the saved IP address and click “Connect.”
5. This window will pop up for you to log in to the computer. User Name: SEA Lab; Password: Vandy123
6. Once you sign in, the iMac window will pop up and you can log in as you would if you were using it in the lab. Log in information is the same -- User Name: SEA Lab; Password: Vandy123

## From a PC:

1. Download VNC viewer: https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/windows/
2. Once installed, launch it and click the button to connect to a remote computer.
3. You only need the IP address, not the vnc:// information
4. Log in to the iMac (User Name: SEA Lab; Password: Vandy123)

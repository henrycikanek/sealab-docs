# How to Pack the Scan Bag


* Only graduate students should be responsible for packing the scan backpack and taking the scan bag home after scan.
* Everything will go in the scan backpack!
* Clipboard, paper materials, and bio samples
    * On the clipboard, please include the following paper items:
        * Cover sheet for the time point (NB cover sheet/checklist, etc.)
        * Tech coordinatorâ€™s worksheet
        * Two copies of the scanning consent form
        * Be sure that the different coordinator protocols are still in the manila folder. They should remain in there at all times, but they could get lost. If so, contact the BABIES coordinator to print more

# SCAN SCHEDULING AND REMINDERS

This page teaches you how to schedule scans and set reminders

## Phone call with parent

1. Administer sleep questionnaire over the phone to gather as much information as possible about the child’s normal bedtime routine to select scan time, child’s sleeping position

2. Scheduling recommendations
    
a. Schedule the time of the MRI scan to match with the child’s normal bedtime. Typically scan will start between 7pm-9pm, though sleep time may vary by individual. 

    For newborn scans, may have success during daytime hours.

c. Recommendation: Ask families how long their normal routine to fall asleep takes and then add 30 minutes. If families do not have a routine, estimate 1 hour. If two people cannot attend (to not allow child to fall asleep on the way to the scan) and a car service isn’t feasible, ask families to arrive much earlier (2+ hours) to make sure the child is tired but not overtired prior to the scan.

3. Address any questions the parent might have about MRI or the visit.

4. Discuss incentives and cancellation policies

5. Inform parents what they will receive in the confirmation email and go over preparative tips. 

## Send confirmation email with necessary files and links after the call

1. Date/time of scan

2. Directions for getting to the scan center/parking

3. Links to videos on what to expect during infant scan

4. Audio file of MRI sequences to familiarize child and parents with MRI sounds before the scan

5. Informational brochure with FAQs for parents about non-sedated MRI scans with infants/toddlers

6. Preparative tips: encourage sleep in the supine position, play MRI sounds, practice lifting and carrying child while asleep 

7. Advise parent to not let child sleep in the car on the ride to the can center, or offer a taxi/ ride service to bring family to the scan center so that parent can make sure the child stays awake

8. If parents thought it would help during initial phone call, advise parent to skip the final daily nap if it occurs within the 3-4 hours prior to arriving at the scan center

9. As age appropriate, encourage parent to bring metal-free sleep props from home to the visit, such as sleep sack, blanket, stuffed animal, pacifier, books, etc. Having a blanket/ toy from home to have familiar smells may help.

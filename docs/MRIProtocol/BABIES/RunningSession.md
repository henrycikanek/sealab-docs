# Running the Session

## Scan Coordinator Protocol

This protocol will detail the role of the team member responsible for:
1. Checking the quality of images during acquisition
2. Facilitating communication between the MRI tech and the other members of the study team during scans
3. Providing a summary report at the end of the scan

The details of these responsibilities will be described below.


## Prior to participant arrival:

- Arrive 30 minutes prior to the scan appointment time to get set up.
- Assist scan team in assembling the pack and play, and laying out the essential items (diapers, wipes, etc. from the clear plastic bag) on the desk.
- Lay one swaddle blanket on the crib area of the pack and play, another on the immobilizer on the swaddle tray, and the third one on the desk (it is for use if the infant gets really sweaty).
- Place ear putty, tape, and minimuff on the desk as well.
- Place the green, plastic rocking chair in the side room, and turn off the lights.
- Fill out the top part of the scan sheet based on information you can find on REDCap (the newborn phone screen form should have information on due date, date of birth, and child’s sex).
- Make sure to get the parent coordinator to ask if the infant is on any medications (including dosage information) and indicate that on the scan sheet).

## Scan Room:

- Two pillowcases over each monitor to block light (kept in the tall standing cabinet in the MRI suite).
- Sheet over the scan bed (kept in the tall standing cabinet in the MRI suite).
- Weighted blanket down on top of sheet (kept in the bottom cabinet next to the door).
- Headphones with covers for baby whisperer (kept in the pull out drawer of the cabinet next to the door).
- Have foam prisms for baby head stability (stored in the back where the Pack ‘n Play is).

1. On personal computer, launch VLC Media Player and open the “Pink Noise with Rain Sounds” video.
2. Turn volume on your computer to max, and set the VLC Media Player volume to 80%.
3. Connect the computer to the aux cord connected to the blue box on the floor, right of the desk holding the FIRMM computer. The aux cord will come from the box in the picture below. 
4. Make sure to turn on the sound system on the AV cart. The switch is on the top left side on the back of the machine. Turn the volume to 15.0 on the sound system and all the way up on the plugged-in device. 
5. Additionally, make sure that both are plugged in. 

We also want to play pre-recorded MRI sounds in the scan suite. Follow these steps:

1. First make sure that the small monitor on their equipment shelf has Windows and Philips headphones selected. Picture shows Rear Projector selected but do not select this for infant scans.
2. Open the computer on the lower desk to the right of the scan tech computer.
3. Log in with your own VU account credentials.
4. Open the DWI sounds on Box (or iPad’s iCloud drive folder).
5. Make sure that the Philips headphone cable is plugged into the computer.
6. Make sure that the computer volume is connected to the REALTEC audio option.
7. Make sure the volume is all the way up, and continue to monitor the audio file in case you have to restart the audio when it ends.
